# 11_Decision_Trees

## 📌 Module Overview
This module explores **Decision Trees**, a supervised learning algorithm used for both **classification and regression** problems.

Decision Trees split data into branches based on feature values, making them easy to understand and interpret.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Tree structure (root, nodes, leaves)  
- Splitting criteria (Gini Index, Entropy, Information Gain)  
- Overfitting and underfitting  
- Tree depth and pruning  
- Bias–variance tradeoff  

---

## 📊 Topics Included

- Decision Tree for classification  
- Decision Tree for regression  
- Feature importance  
- Handling overfitting using pruning techniques  
- Visualizing decision trees  
- Model evaluation methods
