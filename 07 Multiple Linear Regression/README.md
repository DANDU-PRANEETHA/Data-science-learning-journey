# 07_Multiple_Linear_Regression

## 📌 Module Overview
This module covers **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**, a fundamental technique in predictive modeling used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

MLR helps in predicting continuous outcomes and quantifying the impact of several factors simultaneously.
